Open shulkers, from your inventory, simple.

This plugin is easy to install and light-weight on your server. Most interactions are handled asynchronously, which means your server can have a ton of stuff going on, and this plugin should keep on working.

NOTE! - This plugin is under active development and as such, this initial release may be buggy or have the possibility for dupes. I need you to help me find that and I'll fix it quickly.

Anti-Dupe Measures:
- Shulkers opened via Shift + Right Click are locked in place.
- Players MUST close their inventory before interactions become available on shulkers again.
- Shulkers cannot be opened directly in another inventory.
- Shulkers can only be opened from main inventory.
- Drag/Drop checks that ensure shulkers always contain what they should contain, and update with each action to prevent dupes.

Future Features Post-Beta
- Opening shulker from containers.
- Permissions for use and each feature.
- Make the functionality for opening require an item inside for it to be opened without placement. (Opt avail in config.)
- Make a special "Craftable" shulker. (Opt avail in config.)
